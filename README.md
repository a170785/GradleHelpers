# Gradle plugin

This repo is intended to have all my gradle plugins.

Here I'll add custom tasks and build examples of how to use then.

The idea is simple, provide a way to reuse those tasks without messing up my `build.gradle` file with these
custom tasks.

# Contributing

You can contribute but showing your custom tasks, or submitting a new task.
Issues are welcome, create one and we will discourse about it.
If you saw any error, please reports, it will be a great help.

# Licence
You can use any code you found here, some of then I found on the internet too.

I'm using the MIT Licence, take a look on [Licence](LICENCE.MD).

If you're using this plugin, please give me some credits too.
